How I use this document: I click the tab I want (R or python), and control-F to find the operation I'm looking for.

<details>
  <summary>Click here for optional background</summary>

  Climate model output is often represented as a three-dimensional spatiotemporal data cube -- we work with 2-dimensional maps representing a single point in time, so that looking at multiple time points gives us a 3d cube^[This is frequently extended to higher dimensions, e.g., if our climate variable is recorded at different elevations. We're not going to worry about those right now]. This data is frequently recorded in the `netCDF` file format, which end in file extension `.nc`. One nice feature of NetCDFs is that they are self-contained, as they include all of the relevant metadata inside of the file itself. Another nice feature is that you can easily access arbitrary subsets of the data, for convenient lazy loading. Python has great, straightforward support for netCDF -- the community has really rallied around the `xarray` package, and `xarray` was pretty much designed for netCDFs.



In R, things are a little more complicated. A lot of the support for spatiotemporal data in R doesn't come from people working with netCDFs, but from different communitities (e.g. demographers, remote sensing people, everyone that loves GIS). As a result, the popular spatiotemporal packages are designed for super general purpose use. We can almost certainly do all the same netCDF-based analysis as in python, but the documentation for netCDF operations is not as nice. 

Another complicating aspect with working with netCDF in R is that there are multiple packages out there to use, and the ones being actively developed are relatively new. Here's a quick rundown: 

- `terra` is the most general and most powerful package, and it's what I prefer to use in R. It's built as an alternative to the old `raster` package, which used to be popular back in the day.

- `stars` is made more specifically for "data cubes". Probably the closest philisophically aligned to xarray, but it's more general than xarray (in particular, in its abiltiy to handle weird curved grids). 

- `tidync` is made specifically for netCDF files, and it does a good job at picking out the grid of data that we want It's really good at what it does (reading in a netCDF file and taking subsets of it), but the package doesn't do much more than that. As the name suggests, I think this tool is best if your data fits in memory in "long" format (i.e. a dataframe with 1 row per (lat, lon, time)). 

In summary: I think `terra` is the best package for our purposes (i.e working with nicely gridded netCDF). `stars` is cool but is missing a bunch of functionality and documentation (as of this writing). `tidync` is amazing at what it does (i.e. identifying dimensions / lazy filtering), but is too barebones for analysis. It's also worth mentioning that `stars` and `tidync` sometimes make use of the `cubelyr` package, which isn't actively maintained (although it's quite nice).  It's also worth mentioning the low-level packages that are often working under the hood: `sf` is a general spatial package in R that gives us the data class we often store our objects in, and `RNetCDF` is a really low-level package for reading in netcdf data, and `ncdf4` is a little more high level and is still useful for grabbing things like metadata.

## Preliminaries

To start, let's load a bunch of packages and get some utilities

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}


## R

```{r}
# global utils
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(rnaturalearth)

# specific R utils
library(tidync)
library(stars)
library(terra)

# helper function
lon_to_180 <- function(lon360){
  ifelse(lon360 > 180, lon360 - 360, lon360)
}

# example data
coasts <- ne_coastline(returnclass = 'sf')
```

## Python

```{python}
#| code-fold: true

import xarray as xr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import urllib
import gzip
import xesmf as xe # need to get this one from conda-forge. not pip!

```

:::

Let's grab some netCDF files to play with. For demonstration purposes, we'll use a land temperature product -- NASA GISSTEMP (qfe is a quality control adjusted version).  I'm just going to download this one using good old fashioned wget

Let's grab two more files -- two decades of monthly data from a CESM2 historical run, accessed from [here](https://rda.ucar.edu/). Again pulling 2m air temperature. 

(aside: I find this cesm [data dictionary](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2/output-variables) extremely helpful)

# Reading files

Let's start with the cesm file for our demo, assuming that there's a single variable that we're interested in, TREFHT. Compare to the output after reading in the GISTEMP data.


## Reading in a single netcdf

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R


```{r}
# terra
cesm_terra <- rast(cesm_paths[1], subds = 'TREFHT')
gistemp_terra <- rast(ghcn_path, subds = 'tempanomaly')


## this might be equivalent?
# cesm_terra <- rast(cesm_path)
# cesm_terra_TREFHT <- subset(cesm_terra, 'TREFHT')


# stars
cesm_stars <- read_ncdf(cesm_paths[1], var = 'TREFHT', proxy = F)
gistemp_stars <- read_ncdf(ghcn_path, var = 'tempanomaly', proxy = F)


# tidync
cesm_tnc <- tidync(cesm_paths[1])
gistemp_tnc <- tidync(ghcn_path)


```


## Python 

```{python}
gistemp_path = "climate-notebooks/gistemp250_GHCNv4.nc"
gistemp_da = xr.open_dataset(gistemp_path)
gistemp_da = gistemp_da['tempanomaly']

cesm_path1 = 'climate-notebooks/cesm_demo.nc'
cesm1_da = xr.open_dataset(cesm_path1)
cesm1_da = cesm1_da['TREFHT']

cesm_path2 = 'climate-notebooks/cesm_demo2.nc'

cesm2_da = cesm2_da['TREFHT']

## Reading multiple netcdf

Large netCDFs are often split up into multiple files, with each file representing a time chunk. For example, in the CESM files downloaded above, one file represents monthly output for 2000-2010, and the other file represents monthly output for 2010-2014. The two files live on identical grids, so it makes sense to combine them into a single object. (if the two files live on different grids, @sec-regridding might be useful)

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

```{r}

## terra

all_cesm <- rast(cesm_paths) # recall, cesm_paths is a vector containing two files

# if we already have two rasters read in, we can combine them
cesm1 <- rast(cesm_paths[1], subds = 'TREFHT')
cesm2 <- rast(cesm_paths[2], subds = 'TREFHT')
all_cesm_alt <- c(cesm1, cesm2)


## stars

all_cesm_stars <- read_stars(cesm_paths)

## Python

```{python}
cesm_mf = xr.open_mfdataset('climate-notebooks/cesm_demo*.nc')
cesm_mf = cesm_mf['TREFHT']

# Looking at metadata

# terra

units(cesm_terra)
time(cesm_terra)
varnames(cesm_terra)
longnames(cesm_terra)
metags(cesm_terra)


# ncmeta

ncmeta::nc_att(path)
print(ncdf4::nc_open(path))

# tidync

hyper_vars()
nc_get()

# stars

# Preprocessing

## Switching between (-180, 180) and (0, 360) lon

Climate model data usually formats longitudes to be between (0, 360), but observations are typically use (-180, 180).

Below is code to just do this reshift. This is easy for point data (e.g climate model output), because we can just shift the longitude values over. But for polygons (e.g. adding coastlines), this is tricky, because we need to make sure we respect the prime meridian when we shift over.

In general, my recommendation is to move the climate model output to (-180, 180), NOT move the observational data to (0, 360).

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R 

If you want more complex reprojections, see [here](https://r.geocompx.org/reproj-geo-data)

```{r}
# terra
cesm180 <- rotate(cesm_terra)  # recall: cesm_terra is in (0, 360)


## BONUS: an alternate approach using just sf ---------------

# pak::pkg_install('lwgeom') 
library(lwgeom) # useful for st_wrap_x, https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/2058

# example data, which is in (-180, 180)
coasts <- ne_coastline()
plot(st_geometry(x))

# Shift from -180 - 180 to 0 - 360
coasts360 <- st_wrap_x(coasts, 0, 360)
plot(st_geometry(coasts360))

# Shift from 0 - 360 to -180 - 180
# cutline at x = 180
# move things to the left of the cutline by 360
# then move everything left by 360
coasts180 <- st_wrap_x(coasts360, 180, 360)
st_geometry(coasts180) <- st_geometry(coasts180) - c(360, 0)
plot(st_geometry(coasts180))



## bonus bonus: I think these are also supposed to work, but I couldn't figure it out. -----------

# coasts180 <- st_wrap_dateline(coasts360, options = c("WRAPDATELINE=YES", "DATELINEOFFSET=180"))
# coasts180 <- st_shift_longitude(coasts360)

```

## Python

```{python}
# 360 to 180
cesm_180 = cesm_mf.copy()
cesm_180.coords['lon'] = (cesm_180.coords['lon'] + 180) % 360 - 180
cesm_180 = cesm_180.sortby(cesm_180.lon)

# 180 to 360
lon360 = np.mod(cesm_180["lon"], 360)
cesm_360 = cesm180.assign_coords(lon=lon360).sortby("lon")

## Detrending  {#sec-detrending}

Detrending commonly refers to removing a linear time trend.

# Plotting

## Plotting a single map

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R

I'm extremely partial to `ggplot` for plotting, so all of these examples are ggplot based.

```{r}

# terra
library(tidyterra)
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatraster(data = timeavg_terra) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  # + coord_sf(xlim = c(105, 124), ylim = c(32, 45), expand = FALSE) # bonus: zoom into a latlon box



# stars

ggplot() +
  geom_stars(data = timeavg_stars) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  geom_sf(data = x360) + 
  coord_sf()  
  

## Bonus! How to zoom into a lon-lat box:




```


## Python

```{python}
# also worth looking at hvplot!
eg_xr.mean('time').plot()

# Regression

## Separate regressions for each gridcell

In @sec-detrending, we saw how to regress a variable against time. Here, we consider regressing one variable against another.

For our example, we're going to regress CESM temperature against GISTEMP temperature. Note that we're using the re-gridded GISTEMP data, so that the two rasters are on the same grid

## R 

If all we're interested in is the slope, then the `regress` function works well and is fast. But... if we want anything else (e.g. p-values, out of sample predictions), then the `regress` function isn't very useful.
```{r}
##  terra

# method 1: if all we care about is the slope
cesm_gistemp <- regress(cesm_terra, gistemp_terra, formula = y ~ x)
cesm_gistemp$x # a map with the regression slope

# method 2: if we need other regression output (or a different type of regression)
x <- lapp(sds(p, r), \(x, y) {
    sapply(1:nrow(x), \(i) {
        coefficients(lm(b~a, data=data.frame(a=x[i,], b=y[i,])))
        }) |> t()
    })


```

## Python

```{python}

# todo: clean up with example. code gist belongs to karen!

def regression_slope(x, y):
    """
    Get the slope dy/dx, removing missing data points
    """
    # Mask pairs where either x or y is NaN
    mask = np.isfinite(x) & np.isfinite(y)
    if mask.sum() > 1:  # Need at least two points to fit
        fit = linregress(x[mask], y[mask])
        return fit.slope
    else:
        return np.nan  # Return NaN if there are not enough valid data points
    
    

slopes = xr.apply_ufunc(
    regression_slope,
    x,
    y,
    input_core_dims=[['year'], ['year']],
    vectorize=True,
    dask='parallelized',  # Use parallelization if data is large and dask-backed
    output_dtypes=[float]
)

```

<!-- # Conversion between data types

We commonly represent spatiotemporal data cubes as matrices: one row per time point, and one column per spatial gridcell. How do we convert from our spatial objects (i.e. xarray, spatRaster) to this matrix form?

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R


```{r}
# terra -> matrix
mat_terra <- values(cesm_terra)  # each row is a gridcell, each column is a timepoint
t(mat_terra)  # n_time * n_gridcell representation

```

# terra -> stars
terra_to_stars <- st_as_stars(stars_to_terra)


# stars -> terra

# note: this only works if cesm_stars is *not* a stars proxy object!

# tidync -> stars


  st_as_stars.tidync <- function(x, ...) {
  ## x is a tidync
  
  ## ignore unit details for the moment
  data <- lapply(tidync::hyper_array(x, drop = FALSE), 
                 units::as_units)

  dims <- lapply(names(transforms), function(trname) {
    transform <- transforms[[trname]] %>% dplyr::filter(selected)

                     geotransform = rep(NA_real_, 6),

                     point = NA, 
                     values = NULL), 
                class = "dimension")
    }
  })

  structure(data, dimensions =   structure(dims, class = "dimensions"),

}

# tnc_stars <- stars::st_as_stars(tnc_tib, dims = c('lon', 'lat', 'time'))
tnc_stars <- st_as_stars.tidync(cesm_tnc)


## stars implements mutate by going stars -> df -> dplyr::mutate -> stars. Here's how that looks.

# stars to df
stars_df <- stars:::to_df(cesm_stars) 

# df BACK to stars (i.e., assumes that we started with a stars object called cesm_stars)
df_stars <- stars_df %>%
  set_dim(dim(cesm_stars)) %>%
  st_as_stars(dimensions = st_dimensions(cesm_stars))

# terra -> df

tidyterra::as_tibble(cesm_terra, xy = T)

```
